The distinction between ‘digital’ and ‘physical’, between ‘online’ and ‘offline’, once seemingly unambiguous, has begun to blur due to the ubiquity of digital experiences that have permeated most aspects of our modern lives. 
The convergence of physical and digital present us with the opportunities to walk on new pathways of teaching and learning, where we can continue building trusting relationships with students and peers, locally and beyond the boundaries of our specific localities.

I AM A TEACHER: It is my personal wish and professional goal to merge the digital and the physical intentionally by centring my educational practice on civility, community, curiosity and equity.

I AM AN EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPER: I greatly enjoy assisting my educator-colleagues in their teaching career growth and progression. In that capacity, I provide honest, safe and trusting relationships which allow for analysis and experimentation to find those methods and approaches that best suit the individuals, specific groups or entire departments, each within their unique micro-culture and disciplinary contexts. 

I AM ALSO A LEARNER: Working (and living) mean for me to continuously re-imagine the ways in which I can further my own learning and that of my students, clients and peers.  Always open to new experiences, I thrive on focused discussions and the sharing of ideas, hesitations, and/ or critical questions to inform my own practices at work and in every day life.

At the core of my educational values is the belief that by learning new things, listening closely to students/ clients/ peers and tapping into my experience, I can marry honest care with the hard work that is necessary to create truly transformative human learning experiences.

I am currently learning:

    to stay sane in times of great uncertainty and injustice by uniting with unique individuals who care about this earth and humanity,
    to unlearn what comes with my white privilege,
    to feed as little personal data into the big corporate world as possible and educate people to advocate for laws in Northern America that protect us from surveillance capitalism,
    to learn open-source and free software tools and practices,
    to find ways that effectively change the patriarchal society/ working environments I am living in,
    to play the piano by breaking habits of perfectionism and slowly transition into improvisation,
    to bead creatively with the few beadweaving patterns I know,
    to forage for wild edible/ medicinal plants in my immediate and farther surroundings to delve deeper into the wisdom of herbs,
    to tread lightly and leave only a minimal carbon footprint on this earth.
